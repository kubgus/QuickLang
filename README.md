### Pros:
- Simple
- Quick
- Easy to learn
- You look cool when you do it in front of others

### Cons:
- A bit confusing
- Hard to figure out longer code

## Code Snippets:

### Set and Read a variable
Variables can be assigned and accessed just by setting a value in memory.
```
set 0th slot value to 51
)))))]>

set 1st slot value to 28
)))[[>

print the value of the 0th slot
:$>

print the value of the 1st slot
]:$>
```
*When the value of the slot is 0, you can use a colon (:) to get the value of the 0th slot.*
<br />
<br />

### Hello World
You can also write characters with the help of ASCII codes (%).
```
}]]]]%[[[%)[[[%%]]]%> hello
\)))]]%> space
}))[%(]]%]]]%(]]]]%(]]%> world
```

## FAQ:
<br />

> Why does this exist?<br />

#### I wanted to try something new and fun.

<br />

> Why is this useful?<br />

#### It wasn't made to be useful, but fun do learn and code with. But if you know it, it's pretty fast as well.
